# FileUni Release Flow (Project Side)

## Workflow Files

- Upstream trigger in WorkSpace: `.github/workflows/trigger-project-release.yml`
- Downstream build/publish workflow in Project: `FileUni-release.yml`
- Required secret in Project: `FILEUNI_WORKSPACE_PAT`
- CLI npm target manifest: `.github/npm/binary-targets.json`
- GUI npm target manifest: `.github/npm/gui-targets.json`
- npm package builder: `.github/scripts/build_npm_package.py`
- npm package templates: `.github/npm/templates/`

## Trigger Sources

`FileUni-release.yml` is always a `workflow_dispatch` workflow, but it can be reached from three different sources:

| Source | How it is triggered | Key inputs passed to Project | Default release name |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| App tag release | WorkSpace pushes `fileuni-v*` and dispatches Project | `workspace_ref=<tag>`, `trigger_mode=tag`, `prerelease=false` | `FileUni-v...` |
| Nightly release | WorkSpace schedule runs daily at 03:45 Asia/Shanghai (`45 19 * * *` UTC) | `workspace_ref=main`, `trigger_mode=nightly`, `prerelease=true` | `nightly_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` |
| Direct manual dispatch | User runs `FileUni-release.yml` manually in Project | `trigger_mode=manual` by default | `release_name` if provided, otherwise `manually_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` |

## Release Name Resolution

The final GitHub release `tag_name` and display `name` are resolved in this order:

1. `release_name` input, if it is non-empty
2. `trigger_mode=tag` -> `FileUni-v...`
3. `trigger_mode=nightly` -> `nightly_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
4. `trigger_mode=manual` -> `manually_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

Timestamps are generated in the `Asia/Shanghai` timezone.

## Manual Inputs

Important `workflow_dispatch` inputs:

- `workspace_ref` - source ref in `FileUni-WorkSpace`
- `release_name` - optional manual override for the release name
- `trigger_mode` - `manual`, `tag`, or `nightly`
- `build_mode` - `full` or `minimal`
- `build_target` - `cli`, `gui`, or `cli+gui`
- `prerelease` - whether the GitHub release is marked as pre-release
- `enable_upx` - whether UPX-compressed copies are produced where supported

## Stages

1. resolve-matrix - Resolve source ref, release metadata, and build matrix
2. build-frontends - Build CLI and GUI frontend assets from WorkSpace
3. build-cli - Build CLI artifacts across cargo-dist, cross, Android, BSD, and package formats
4. build-gui - Build GUI artifacts across desktop Tauri, Android, and iOS paths
5. publish - Collect standardized `FileUni-*` artifacts, generate release notes, and publish the GitHub Release
6. update-package-indexes - Update Homebrew tap, Scoop bucket, and Nix package sources for CLI and GUI after a full tag release
7. publish-npm - Build and publish the `fileuni` and `fileuni-gui` npm packages after the GitHub Release is available

## Artifact Naming

- Final release assets are standardized as `FileUni-*`
- Architecture, OS, and libc naming are centralized in `.github/scripts/arch-helpers.sh`
- The publish step removes non-standard filenames before uploading release assets
- The npm packages download those same standardized GitHub Release assets during `postinstall`
- GUI macOS releases now publish both signed-download-friendly `.dmg` assets and portable `.app.zip` assets for package-manager reuse

## Build Coverage

The exact matrix is resolved from `.github/build_matrix.jsonc`, but the workflow currently supports:

- CLI native and cross builds
- CLI Android builds
- CLI FreeBSD builds
- Linux package builds via nFPM
- npm single-package distribution for CLI on Linux `gnu` / `musl`, Windows, macOS, Android, and FreeBSD
- npm desktop-package distribution for GUI on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Homebrew formula updates for macOS and Linux CLI assets
- Homebrew cask updates for macOS GUI assets
- Scoop bucket updates for Windows CLI and GUI assets
- Nix package repo updates for CLI on Linux and macOS, and GUI on Linux
- GUI desktop Tauri builds
- GUI Android APK builds
- GUI iOS IPA packaging

## npm Publish Rules

- npm publish is enabled only when `build_mode=full`
- Homebrew, Scoop, and Nix index updates run only for `trigger_mode=tag` releases with both CLI and GUI builds enabled
- npm publish runs after the GitHub Release has been published, because the npm packages download release assets by `release_tag`
- npm publish uses npm Trusted Publisher with GitHub Actions OIDC
- no `NPM_TOKEN` secret is required for npm publishing
- the npm package settings must trust `FileUni/FileUni-Project` and the `FileUni-release.yml` workflow
- stable versions are published with the `latest` npm dist-tag, while prerelease versions derive a non-`latest` dist-tag from the semver prerelease label
- the CLI package name is `fileuni`
- the GUI package name is `fileuni-gui`
- both packages auto-detect the current platform during `postinstall`
- Linux defaults to `gnu` when detection is ambiguous, and users can override the target with package-specific env vars

## npm Package Layout

- CLI package name: `fileuni`
- GUI package name: `fileuni-gui`
- CLI target metadata is defined in `.github/npm/binary-targets.json`
- GUI target metadata is defined in `.github/npm/gui-targets.json`
- The generated packages contain only JavaScript launch/install files and download the real release assets from GitHub Releases on demand
- `packages/npm/` is retired; release publishing now uses `.github/npm/` only

## Notes

- The upstream dispatch workflow uses `ref: main` for the workflow file version, while `workspace_ref` controls which WorkSpace source ref is checked out and built.
- CLI remains friendly to cross-compilation, while GUI release jobs include platform-specific packaging steps.

## Package Manager Repos

- Homebrew tap repo: `FileUni/homebrew-fileuni`
- Scoop bucket repo: `FileUni/scoop-fileuni`
- Nix package repo: `FileUni/nixpkgs-fileuni`
- Repository contents are generated in CI from `.github/package-repos/` templates and `.github/scripts/update_package_indexes.py`
- `FileUni-release.yml` clones those standalone repos, regenerates their contents in a temporary workspace, and pushes updates directly
- `Crontab_Subtree.yml` does not manage package manager repositories
