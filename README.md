FileUni is a next-generation storage and file management platform built with Rust for performance, security, and modular deployment.

From ultra-light devices to full servers, FileUni is designed to provide NAS-style capabilities without requiring dedicated hardware, while keeping one scalable codebase across CLI, GUI, and web-facing components.

Another important characteristic is compatibility with Nextcloud clients. File management, favorites, shares, media-related flows, and WebDAV access are positioned to stay compatible with the Nextcloud client ecosystem, while Chat and Notes remain on the follow-up roadmap.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is the public project hub for FileUni. It is mainly used for:

- Automated build and release workflows
- Distribution publishing for CLI and GUI through GitHub Releases, Homebrew, Scoop, npm, and Nix
- Public issue tracking and feedback
- Community-facing project coordination
- Subtree-based downstream sync targets

The main development workspace lives in the private monorepo and selected components are synchronized here for release and public collaboration.

## Why FileUni

- High-performance Rust architecture
- Modular design for different deployment sizes
- NAS features without dedicated hardware
- Nextcloud client compatibility across WebDAV, file management, favorites, shares, and media flows
- Multi-protocol access including FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and S3
- Storage-oriented reliability and security focus
